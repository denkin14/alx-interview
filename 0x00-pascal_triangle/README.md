Pascal Triangle

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the first and last number in each row is 1, and each of the other numbers is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The rows of Pascal's triangle are numbered starting with row 0, and the nth row contains n+1 numbers. The pattern of numbers in Pascal's triangle is related to binomial coefficients and can be used to expand binomials raised to a certain power. It also appears in many other areas of mathematics, such as probability theory, algebra, and geometry.
