The solution uses two steps to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. First, it transposes the matrix by swapping each element with its corresponding element across the diagonal. Then, it reverses each row of the matrix.

Note that this solution modifies the original matrix in-place, so there is no need to return anything.
