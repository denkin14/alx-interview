UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme used to represent Unicode characters. In UTF-8, a single character can be represented by one to four bytes, depending on the Unicode code point. To determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding, we need to check if each byte in the sequence conforms to the UTF-8 encoding rules.

The UTF-8 encoding rules are as follows:

1. For a single-byte character (Unicode code points 0-127), the most significant bit (MSB) is 0 and the other 7 bits represent the character.

2. For a multi-byte character, the MSB of the first byte is 1 and the number of consecutive 1s in the MSB determines the number of bytes in the character. The remaining bits in the first byte and all subsequent bytes start with "10". The character code is formed by concatenating the remaining bits in the first byte with the remaining bits in each subsequent byte, in order.
